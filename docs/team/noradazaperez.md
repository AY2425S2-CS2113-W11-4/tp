## Overview
TripBuddy is a simple expense-tracking application designed to help users manage costs for a single trip. It allows
travelers to log expenses, categorize them, and view a summary of their spendings in one place.

#### Enhancements Implemented
I implemented the following commands:

  * `view-currency` : a command that displays the exchange rate between the base currency and the available currencies
  * `set-base-currency` : a command that changes the base currency 
  * `Currency` class that represents the different currencies 
* `view-history` : a command that displays the past expenses
