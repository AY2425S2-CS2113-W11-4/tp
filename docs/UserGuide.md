# User Guide

## Introduction

TripBuddy is a simple expense-tracking application designed to help users manage costs for a single trip. It allows 
travelers to log expenses, categorize them, and view a summary of their spendings in one place. TripBuddy ensures 
budgeting is easy and hassle-free, so travelers can focus on enjoying their trip.

## Setup Guide

- Make sure Java 17 is installed on your device.
- Download `[CS2113-W11-4][tripbuddy].jar` from the [release site](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-W11-4/tp/releases)
- Run the program with command:
```
java -jar [CS2113-W11-4][tripbuddy].jar
```

## Notes about the command format

- Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
e.g. in `set-budget AMOUNT`, AMOUNT is a parameter which can be used as `set-budget 1000`.
- Square brackets `[]` indicate optional elements that can be omitted.
- Extraneous parameters will be ignored and have no effects.
(e.g. if the command specifies quit 123, it will be interpreted as quit.)
- **Avoid using excessively larger/small values or overlength names**.
